# facebookLoginiOS9
an iOS swift application that successfully captures a user's basic account info from facebook, and stores it in parse. note, this app includes custom methods outside of the facebook provided methods to pass the user's facebook info to parse because, at this time (8.1.205) parse doesn't work with iOS 9 FB SDK. 

you will need to provide your own applicationID and key from parse to make this work.
